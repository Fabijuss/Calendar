## Epics and User Stories
 ### Epic
  A command-line based program which allows you to read, write or edit entries into a text-based calendar.
 ### User Stories   
 #### Display

#### Write
The calendar program should be able to write entries into a text file; the entries should include the date in a readable format and the entry next to it.
#### Edit
The calendar program should be able to edit the existing calendar; any entries added should follow the same format.
#### Date
The calendar program should allow the user to edit the date, so that they can add or edit entries at different dates.
